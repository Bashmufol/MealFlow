# MealFlow üçΩÔ∏è

A full-stack, role-based web application designed to modernize and streamline the corporate canteen ordering process. It allows company employees to pre-order their meals from the office canteen and allows canteen staff to manage the menu and orders. Employees can pre-order meals to save time, and canteen staff can efficiently manage menus and incoming orders through a dedicated admin dashboard.
